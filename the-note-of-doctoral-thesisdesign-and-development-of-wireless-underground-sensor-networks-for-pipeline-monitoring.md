### the note of doctoral thesis《DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF WIRELESS UNDERGROUND SENSOR NETWORKS FOR PIPELINE MONITORING》

### 1. Abstract
a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in pipeline monitoring is presented and the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are discussed. an ultra-low power Wireless Underground Sensor Network (WUSN) has been carefully researched, designed, developed and presented as part of this project.
- node communication
- power consumption(by multiple iterations of software and hardware design)
- data management(dispensable)
- sensor(a novel non-invasive relative pressure sensor--FSR、)
