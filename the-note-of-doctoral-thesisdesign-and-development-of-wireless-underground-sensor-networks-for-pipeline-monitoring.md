### the note of doctoral thesis《DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF WIRELESS UNDERGROUND SENSOR NETWORKS FOR PIPELINE MONITORING》

### 0. Abstract
a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in pipeline monitoring is presented and the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are discussed. an ultra-low power Wireless Underground Sensor Network (WUSN) has been carefully researched, designed, developed and presented as part of this project.
- node communication
- power consumption(by multiple iterations of software and hardware design)
- data management(dispensable)
- sensor(a novel non-invasive relative pressure sensor--FSR、temperature sensor)
    -  measure daily pressure variations
    -  detect leak
    -  leak detection position
- improved model for approximation of RF signal attenuation in soil

### 1. introductiom
#### 1.1 significance 
Transportation of vital commodities such as water, oil and gas is commonly done by means of pipeline networks. Faults in these pipes can create major financial implications and possible environmental catastrophes.with the development of "Internet of Things",wireless sensor network not only provide operators with a better understanding of their network, but also will have a higher reliability and a faster response to faults.
