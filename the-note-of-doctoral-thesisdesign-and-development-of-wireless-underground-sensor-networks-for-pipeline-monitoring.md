### the note of doctoral thesis《DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF WIRELESS UNDERGROUND SENSOR NETWORKS FOR PIPELINE MONITORING》

### 0. Abstract
a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in pipeline monitoring is presented and the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are discussed. an ultra-low power Wireless Underground Sensor Network (WUSN) has been carefully researched, designed, developed and presented as part of this project.
- node communication
- power consumption(by multiple iterations of software and hardware design)
- data management(dispensable)
- sensor(a novel non-invasive relative pressure sensor--FSR、temperature sensor)
    -  measure daily pressure variations
    -  detect leak
    -  leak detection position
- improved model for approximation of RF signal attenuation in soil

### 1. introductiom
#### 1.1 Background and motivation 
Transportation of vital commodities such as water, oil and gas is commonly done by means of pipeline networks. Faults in these pipes can create major financial implications and possible environmental catastrophes.with the development of "Internet of Things",underground wireless sensor network not only provides operators with a better understanding of their network, but also will has a higher reliability and a faster response to faults. 

The main method for detecting and locating leaks in pipe:
- acoustic measurements （声学）
- pressure measurements（压力）
- vision-based systems（计算机视觉）
- Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) based systems （探地雷达）
- fibre optic monitoring（光纤检测）
- multimodal systems（多种模式）

the main issues in continuous infrastructure monitoring
- power consumption
- power availability
- sensor performance
    - power consumption
    - ease of installation 
    - cost and reliability
- data transmission

The focus of this research was on the single-hop (star network) WSN for pipeline monitoring.(星型网络实现节点通信)This monitoring system contain many other sub-systems.

#### 1.2 Aim and objectives
The principal aim of this research is to design and manufacture a long-term, ultra low power continuous condition assessment monitoring system for buried water pipelines.
#####The following objectives:
(1) identify the parameters affecting the power consumption of underground wireless sensor nodes
(2) design and manufacture an ultra-low power wireless sensor node for pipeline monitoring
(3) minimise the power consumption of the node through hardware and software optimisation
(4) design and develop non-invasive sensors and assess their performance
(5) assess the performance of the node and sensors and assess leak detection capabilities of the system
(6) investigate the effect of soil on Radio Frequency (RF) signal propagation
