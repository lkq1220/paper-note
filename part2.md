###### Figure 1 Limitations and requirements of WUSN for pipeline monitoring
- Environment limitation
  - High RF signal
  - Lake of maintainablity
  - Lake of access to the power supply
  - Harsh environment
- Application requirements
  - Ease of installation
  - Low cost
  - Long operational life
  - Non-invastive to the structure of the pipe
  - Capable of detecting abnormalities in pipes

##### 3.2.1 Node design overview Having
##### 3.2.2 Power consumption
##### 3.2.3 Hardware design
##### 3.2.4 Firmware design

#### 3.3 Summary
- ##### The most desirable specification for a successful WUSN for pipeline monitoring
  - Ease of installation
  - Low cost
  - Long operational life(low power consumption)
    - The sleep mode was identified as the main consumer of the total energy
    - An increase in the operational frequency of the MCU will result in a reduction of the ON duration and consequently a reduction in overall power consumption
    - The final version of the developed node had an extremely low average power consumption of 1.31 ÂµW for one measurement and transmission every six hours
  - Non-invastive to the structure of the pipe
