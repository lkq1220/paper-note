##### 3.2.1 Node design overview 
- Four main subsystems for the hardware WUSN node 
  - Microcontroller Unit (MCU)
    - gathering the data
    - process data
    - run the leak detection algorithms
    - buffer data into the tranceiver
    - time
    - ultra-low power microcontroller 
  - transceiver
    - send data to the mater node
  - power management
    - condition and manage the supplied power
  - signal conditioning 
    - A/D Conversion
    
##### 3.2.2 Power consumption

##### 3.2.3 Hardware design

##### 3.2.4 Firmware design

#### 3.3 Summary
- ##### The most desirable specification for a successful WUSN for pipeline monitoring
  - Ease of installation
  - Low cost
  - Long operational life(low power consumption)
    - The sleep mode was identified as the main consumer of the total energy
    - An increase in the operational frequency of the MCU will result in a reduction of the ON duration and consequently a reduction in overall power consumption
    - The final version of the developed node had an extremely low average power consumption of 1.31 ÂµW for one measurement and transmission every six hours
  - Non-invastive to the structure of the pipe
