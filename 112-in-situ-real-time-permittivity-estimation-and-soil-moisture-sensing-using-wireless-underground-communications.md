### In situ real-time permittivity estimation and soil moisture sensing using wireless underground communications

#### 0. Abstract
- Method(real-time in situ estimation of relative permittivity of soil, and soil moisture)
    -be determined from the propagation path loss, and velocity of wave propagation of an underground (UG) transmitter and receiver link in wireless underground communications
- Result
The estimated soil parameters have less than 8% estimation error from the ground truth measurements and semi-empirical dielectric mixing models
