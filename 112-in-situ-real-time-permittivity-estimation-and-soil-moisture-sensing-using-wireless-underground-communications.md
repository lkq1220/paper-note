### In situ real-time permittivity estimation and soil moisture sensing using wireless underground communications

#### 0. Abstract
- Detail

- Method(real-time in situ estimation of relative permittivity of soil, and soil moisture)
    -be determined from the propagation path loss, and velocity of wave propagation of an underground (UG) transmitter and receiver link in wireless underground communications
- Result
    - The estimated soil parameters have less than 8% estimation error from the ground truth measurements and semi-empirical dielectric mixing models
    
#### 1. Introduction
- Why
    - one major bottleneck in the current laboratory-based permittivity estimation techniques is off-line measurement of the collected soil samples
- Electromagnetic (EM) waves propagates through the soil
   - depth
   - distance
   - frequency
   - soil moisture
   - properties of the soi
- How 
    1. a transmitter antenna buried at a certain depth in soil transmits a wideband signal in frequency range of 100â€“500 MHz, which propagates through the UG channel. 
    2. The received signal is measured at the receiver to determine the path loss. 
    3. estimate the soil moisture and permittivity based on path loss using Di-Sense
- Verification
    - Ground truth measurements
    - Semiempirical Peplinski dielectric mixing model
    - Topp mode
