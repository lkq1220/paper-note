##  A New Approach to Estimating the Path Loss in Underground Wireless Sensor Networks
### 0. Abstract
- #### Why
  - Due to the complexity of soil, accurate estimation of the underground signal attenuation is challenging.
- #### What
  - In this paper, two existing models for estimating the path loss in soil (i.e., the CRIM-Fresnel and Modified-Friis models) are compared with measurements obtained at three locations. In addition,an improved method is proposed for estimating the path loss based on a new approach for calculating the dielectric properties of soil from Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) measurements.
- #### New approach 
  - Calculates the complex permittivity values from TDR waveform based on a new modified
method and subsequently use them as inputs into the Modified-Friis model.
- #### Result
  - The results of this comparison showed that the proposed estimation technique provides a better estimation of Radio Frequency (RF) attenuation than the existing models.
