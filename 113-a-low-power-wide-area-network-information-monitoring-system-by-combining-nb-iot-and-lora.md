- Aim
    - Long range
    - A small amount of data transmission
    - Low power
    - Low cost of the Internet of Things (IoT) in actual applications
- Method
    - Multiple subnodes(LoRa node)
    - Main node(NB-IoT && LoRa gateway)
    - A could Server
    - Computer System
    - Optical-electric conversion technology
- Advantage
    - Improves transmission distance
    - Reduces the operating costs of the WAN information monitoring system
- Results 
    - the communication distance in a complex environment is up to 1.6 km
    - the minimum working current is 2 mA
    - the system communication packet loss rate is approximately 3%
