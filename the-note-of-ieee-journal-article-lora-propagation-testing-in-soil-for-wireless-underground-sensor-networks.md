### the note of IEEE journal article 《LoRa Propagation Testing in Soil for Wireless Underground Sensor Networks》

#### 0. Abstract
LoRa provides new in-soil propagation means for wireless sensor networks with some node buried underground.The LoRa propagation characteristics related to volumetric water content, burial depth and payload are experimentally evaluated with the testing node.The test results shows that the packet success rate based LoRa in-soil propagation evaluations can be obtained by the testnode.
