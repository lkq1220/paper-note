### the note of IEEE journal article 《LoRa Propagation Testing in Soil for Wireless Underground Sensor Networks》

#### 0. Abstract
LoRa provides new in-soil propagation means for wireless sensor networks with some node buried underground.The LoRa propagation characteristics related to volumetric water content, burial depth and payload are experimentally evaluated with the testing node.The test results shows that the packet success rate based LoRa in-soil propagation evaluations can be obtained by the testnode.

#### 1. Introduction
- ##### WUSN
  - WUSN Introduction： WUSNs are sensor networks that comprise wireless underground sensor devices, which send and receive data or instructions in the soil
  - WUSN Application Fields
    - agriculture
    - accident prevention
    - security
    - transportation
    - structural engineering
    - earth science
  - The Challenge Of WUSN
    -  WUSNs are immature
    - The in-soil propagation loss of radio signal is key bottleneck for WUSNs
